Useful tricks and extensions for Fenics and other FEM tools in Python

FE + tricks : where FE stands for Fenics, Finite Element, and the author of this (maybe) useful thing. 

This little project is born with the aim of assembling some tricks and extensions of Fenics (2019.1) and other FEM-related routines I have been using in different codes. They are mostly concerning applications in Continuum Mechanics, but not only that. There are also data management functions wrapping HDF5 python implementation.

Some of the public projects that use fetricks are micmacsfenics (https://github.com/felipefr/micmacsFenics) and ddfenics (https://github.com/felipefr/micmacsFenics).

I should acknowledge the excellent tutorial of Jeremy Bleyer (https://comet-fenics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), from which some functions have adapted.
